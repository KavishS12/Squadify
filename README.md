## Introduction
Squadify is a data-driven football squad optimization tool designed to assist clubs, analysts, fantasy football players, and enthusiasts in creating the most effective squad within a given budget. The project leverages machine learning and optimization techniques to build an optimal starting XI while ensuring tactical balance, potential growth, and financial feasibility.

---

## Problem Statement
Building an optimal starting XI for a European football club within a â‚¬150M budget, focusing on young talent and tactical balance for the next 5 years.

#### Key Considerations:
- **Current Ability & Future Growth** â€“ Identify high-potential young players.
- **Market Value & Transfer Feasibility** â€“ Stay within budget constraints.
- **Tactical Compatibility** â€“ Ensure players fit the teamâ€™s playing style.
- **Performance Data** â€“ Analyze recent statistics for consistency & impact.

#### Challenges in Traditional Squad Building
1. **Intuition and Biases** - Subjective decision-making based on coach intuition.
2. **Player Form and Chemistry** - Balancing player form, fitness, and chemistry is difficult.
3. **Misses Out on Potential Stars** - Traditional methods may not consider all possible squad combinations.
4. **Overemphasis on Market Value** - Expensive players are often preferred without deeper analysis.

---

## Proposed Solution
#### 1. **Statistics-Based Approach**
- Processes *6,000+ player profiles* spanning 5 seasons.
- Integrates technical metrics such as goals, assists, tackles, and passing from Europe's top 5 leagues.

#### 2. **Advanced Machine Learning Pipeline**
- Uses *ensemble modeling* to predict player performance trajectories.
- Identifies *hidden statistical correlations* between player attributes and performance metrics.

#### 3. **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**
- Generates and evolves thousands of squad combinations.
- Balances immediate performance with long-term development goals.
- Ensures formation balance and penalizes squads exceeding budget constraints.

### Target Users
- **Football Coaches & Managers** - Data-driven squad selection insights.
- **Fantasy Football Enthusiasts** - Enhances fantasy football team-building experience.
- **Scouting Agencies & Analysts** - Provides a modular database for deeper player analysis.

### Market Opportunity
- **$2.5B+ sports analytics market**, expected to grow **10x at 20% CAGR by 2030**.
- Increasing **AI adoption** by football clubs for player scouting and performance analysis.
- Growing **fantasy football market** requiring AI-driven insights.

---

## Data Collection
Data was scraped from football statistics platforms:
- **FBRef** - Performance and match statistics.
- **Transfermarkt** - Market values and player images.
- **SoFIFA** - FIFA attributes for labeling.

### Processed Dataset:
- *6,181 players* with *24 features*.
- Includes statistics such as *shooting, defense, passing*, and general player information.
- Weighted averages were calculated for multi-season data.
- Adjustments were made for players with injury-related missing stats.

---

## Machine Learning Approach
- Hybrid model using *XGBoost, Linear Regression, SVMs, and Decision Trees*.
- Uses *1,000 expert-labeled samples from FIFA* as ground truth.
- Predicts custom ratings based on correlations between raw stats and FIFA ratings.

### Player Ratings (Out of 100):
- **Overall** - Holistic measure of quality.
- **Future Potential** - Career growth projection.
- **Passing Ability** - Accuracy and impact.
- **Shooting** - Goal conversion efficiency.
- **Defensive Strength** - Tackling and positioning.
- **Goalkeeping Prowess** - Shot-stopping ability.

---

## Optimization Algorithm - Genetic Selection
- **Randomized population selection** for potential teams.
- **Evaluation** based on skill, potential, and chemistry.
- **Crossover and mutation techniques** to improve squad quality.
- **Elitism mechanism** to retain top-rated players.

### Customization & User Control
- **Budget Constraints** - Ensures selections remain within financial limits.
- **Squad Formation Selection** - Supports multiple formations.
- **Advanced Filtering** - Allows users to select nations, clubs, and experience levels.
- **Chemistry Boosts** - Players from the same club or nation receive synergy boosts.

# Project Setup Instructions

This repository contains three main components:

- **Frontend** (MERN Stack - React)
- **Backend** (MERN Stack - Express & MongoDB)
- **Squad Optimization** (Python Flask API for squad selection)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (for frontend and backend)
- **MongoDB Atlas** (for database)
- **Python 3** (for squad optimization)
- **pip** (for installing Python dependencies)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Frontend

The frontend is built using React. To set it up:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

By default, the frontend connects to the deployed backend. If you want to run everything locally, update the backend API URLs in the frontend code to:

```
http://localhost:5000/  (Backend API)
http://localhost:5001/  (Squad Optimization API)
```

**Running the project locally is preferred for faster response time and lower latency, as the deployed version is hosted on a free instance on Render, which may have slower response times.**

### 2. Backend

The backend is built using Node.js and Express. To run it:

```sh
cd backend
npm install
```

You need to set up your MongoDB connection. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```
#### Seeding the Database (Insert Sample Data)

The backend contains a script to populate the database with sample player data. To insert players into the database:

```sh
cd backend/scripts
node insertPlayers.js
```

This script reads `data.json` and inserts player records in batches of 500.

Ensure MongoDB is running before executing this script.
Once the script runs successfully, youâ€™ll see logs confirming batch insertions.

Then, start the backend server:

```sh
npm start
```

### 3. Squad Optimization

The squad optimization module is implemented using Python and Flask. Install the required dependencies:

```sh
cd squad_optimization
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Flask server:

```sh
python squad_optimization.py
```

## Switching Between Local and Deployed Backend

If you want to switch between a local and deployed backend, update the API URLs in the frontend's configuration accordingly:

- **Local Backend:** `http://localhost:5000/`
- **Deployed Backend:** `https://squadify-backend.onrender.com/`
- **Local Squad Optimization API:** `http://localhost:5001/`
- **Deployed Squad Optimization API:** `https://squadify.onrender.com/`

**Note: Running the backend locally is preferred for faster response times and lower latency.**
